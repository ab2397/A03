8. For Windows user, click on the “Windows” download link \ 
9. Click on the execution file once the download is finished, and go through the Installation Wizard for **Git**(stick with the default choices for now). \
10. After that, create a **GitHub** account using your school email: https://github.com/join (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \
11. Open up Webstorm, and use the shortcut key “Ctrl+Alt+S”, on the Welcome window, to enter the System Preference settings (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \
12. Select Version Control, and then **Git**, in the left side of the System Preference setting \
13. The “Path to Git executable” should be already detected by Webstorm. If not, then select the “...” button, and find the **Git** executable in your File Explorer. \ 
14. Click Test to make sure that Webstorm is connected to **Git**…If **Git** is installed correctly, you should get the message “Git Executed Successfully.” The version number is displayed. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
15. Select Version Control, and then **GitHub**, in the left side of the System Preference setting \
16. Add your **GitHub** account in Webstorm, and click OK (in the bottom of System Preference) to exit \
17. To create a repository in **GitHub**, log in to **GitHub** and click the “+” button, on the top-right corner, and click “New repository” (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \
18. Give a name to your **repository**, Add a README file by clicking the checkbox, and make sure that your **repository** is set to Public. (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \
19. Click “Create” and your **repository** will be made. (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \
20. To create a **repository** in Webstorm, first, open Webstorm and select “Create New Project” (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
21. Choose a location and give the project a name. Then, click Create. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
22. Now, create an HTML file that will be used later to test GitHub Page. Click File -> New -> HTML File, and name the file index.html (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
23. Make some changes in the default code, and then save the code. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
24. Now create the Git **Repository** by clicking VCS(Version Control System)-> Import into Version Control-> Create Git Repository, and then click OK once you selected the project that you created in WebStorm (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
25. To commit the changes that you made in your file to **Git**. go to VCS->Git -> Commit File (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
26. Select the index.html file that you want to commit, and add a commit comment if you want. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
27. Click **Commit**. If this is the first commit ever, you will have a dialog box open. Set the **Git** username and email. Use your .EDU email.  [Click Set and Commit]. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
28. Finally, add the project to **GitHub**. Click VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on Github. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
29. Click Share. You will receive a message “Successfully shared project on GitHub.”. If you check your **GitHub** account, you will see the new **repository**. (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
30. Whenever you make any new changes to your code, you first **commit** the change, and then **push** the change to **GitHub** by clicking VCS -> Git -> Push or [Ctrl+Shift+K] (Hendela “Extra Git…”) \
31. If you’ve made changes through **GitHub** (Ex. Create README file), then when you **push** the changes you made in WebStorm, there will be a popup rejecting the **push** attempt because the **Remote**(GitHub) changes need to be merged before pushing \
32. Click the **Merge** button to synchronize **GitHub** and your local machine (WebStorm) \
33. The last thing to do is setting up GitHub Pages to run your HTML files live. Go to one of your **repositories** (with the HTML file you want to test) in **GitHub**, and click Settings.  (Hendela “Introduction to Git…”) \ 
34. Click Pages, under the Code and automation settings on the left side, and select your master/main branch to be deployed, under Branch located below Build and deployment. \
35. Click Save, and then refresh the page or navigate through different settings until you return back to Pages with the link to your site being deployed. \
